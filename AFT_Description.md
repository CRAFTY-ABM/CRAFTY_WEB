**Land use types and initial allocation**

Allocation is based on the 2015 Land Cover Map (LCM2015) produced by the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (2016) and the National Forest Inventory (NFI) 2010-2015 (Forestry Commission, 2021). Further datasets are used to define the extent and location of specific land uses as described in the table. Levels of intensity are assigned discretely in terms of agent types, but modelled continuously across these types according to availability and usage of agricultural inputs and production levels.
