## CRAFTY-GB

CRAFTY-GB is a spatially-explicit agent-based model of land use change in Great Britain. It is an application of the CRAFTY modelling framework [link to general page] and was developed as a joint project between the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the University of Edinburgh, and UK Forest Research.

The model operates at 1 km2 resolution and includes agricultural, forestry, urban and conservation land uses at a range of intensities.  The model simulates the provision of a range of ecosystem services, and is linked to the global LandSyMM model [website link] to account for global effects including trade of food commodities. 

CRAFTY-GB simulates land use change between 2020 and 2080 as the result of climatic and socio-economic impacts derived from the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) global scenarios. These have been tailored to the British context through a combination of computational modelling and stakeholder engagement [[link1]](https://ukscape.ceh.ac.uk/our-science/projects/SPEED/shared-socioeconomic-pathways) [[link2]](https://www.ukclimateresilience.org/projects/uk-socioeconomic-scenarios-for-climate-research-and-policy/).

CRAFTY is a completely open-access modelling framework and full details can be found [here (https://landchange.earth/CRAFTY/)](https://landchange.earth/CRAFTY/)
