### Competition for Resources between Agent Functional Types (CRAFTY)

CRAFTY is a large-scale agent-based modelling (ABM) framework for the simulation of land use change. It is designed to allow efficient but powerful simulation of a wide range of land uses across large geographical extents, based on the decision-making of simulated land managers who generate a variety of ecosystem services. It is fully open-source and can be used without the need for any programming.

 
The basic framework is described in Murray-Rust et al. 2014, and the following variations and applications have also been produced:

- CRAFTY-Sweden: Blanco et al. (2017)
- CRAFTY-EU: Brown et al. (2019)
- Institutional modelling: Holzhauer et al. (2019)
