### Competition for Resources between Agent Functional Types (CRAFTY)

Welcome to the web-app for the CRAFTY agent-based modelling (ABM) framework. CRAFTY is a large-scale ABM of land use change. It is designed to allow efficient but powerful simulation of a wide range of land uses and the goods and services they produce. It is fully open-source and can be used without the need for any programming. An ODD description (1) is available here.
At first, you might want to get to know CRAFTY's Features and Model Structure.
It is then a good idea to choose the CRAFTY version you like to apply. Whereas the main documentation is tailored to basic CRAFTY, the other versions are described in section Special Versions Documentation. The subpages contain lists of particular versions' features, but you may see here for an overview.
